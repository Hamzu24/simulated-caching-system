## Cache Simulator

A cache simulator that models the behavior of a CPU cache hierarchy by processing memory access traces. The program simulates cache operations (loads and stores) and tracks performance metrics.

### Features

- **Configurable Cache Parameters:**
  - Set index bits (`-s`): Number of cache sets (2^s)
  - Associativity (`-E`): Lines per set
  - Block bits (`-b`): Block size (2^b bytes)

- **LRU Replacement Policy:** Implements Least Recently Used eviction strategy

- **Dirty Bit Tracking:** Monitors write-back cache behavior with dirty byte accounting

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Cache hits and misses
  - Evictions
  - Dirty evictions
  - Total dirty bytes

- **Verbose Mode:** Optional detailed trace of each memory operation (`-v` flag)

### Usage
```bash
./csim -s  -E  -b  -t  [-v]
```

### Input Format

Reads trace files containing memory operations:
- `L` - Load operation
- `S` - Store operation

Each line: `<operation> <address>,<size>`

### Implementation

- Simulates set-associative cache with configurable parameters
- Parses hexadecimal memory addresses into tag, set index, and block offset
- Tracks cache line state (valid, dirty, LRU counter)
- Outputs summary statistics for cache performance analysis
